# pyCOVID19
Combination of Selenium(Webscraping), MySQL, and ML to analyze data related to COVID-19

pyCOVID is a personal project of mine to test and apply what I've learned about python and its various tools. It begins with Webscraping
data from several websites that host data related to COVID-19. Initially this is just data based of the city for the number of cases.
Then after webscraping the approriate data, we upload and use MySQL, locally, to store the data and maintain it in a database that updates
accordingly when it needs to. After the data has been collected, we finally use models of machine learning and statistical analysis to
analyze the data and see if we can make any future predictions and/or updates.

Initially, for me the project was meant to exemplify my knowledge of python on a currently global topic of interest and for myself, see
what it really means to 'flatten the curve'. As I progress through the project, several changes will be made in terms of the...
  - type of data that is being compared (ex. temp of a city vs. new cases of COVID)
  - Geographical Location of Cities (Starting with Canada).
  
 Project definitely in its origin phase, a lot of work left to do, to streamline and organize the code itself.
 
 Schedule:
 
May 18, 2020 - Start Date for Project
